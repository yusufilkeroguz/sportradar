# SPORTRADAR TEST CASE

## Libraries

- [Storeon](https://github.com/storeon/storeon): That library is a tiny (1.2 KB) event-based state manager for React, Preact, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks. It is a simple and fast alternative to Redux, MobX, and other state managers. And has localstorage support.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. This css framework is so easy to use and it has a lot of components that can be used in the project. Thats whyi choose it.
